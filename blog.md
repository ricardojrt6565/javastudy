# JavaStudy
## Week 1 

The week started off with the contemplation of what to create and what language would be most efficient in accomplishing our goal. I found a partner that shares the same interests as me, so I choose to work with him and we went straight to the white board. I wanted to do something that involved solving a problem, something that can help on an everyday basis. However, I didn't come up with anything interesting so I and my partner decided
to make a game. Since the beginning of Freshman year, me and my partner always wanted to create a game with our software skills. We created smalls games here and there, but nothing too big. The idea of making a game sounded nice too, so we stuck with it. 

### So..
We agreed upon the language Java, a powerful language that can help us create a decent enough game to feel good about. We also agreed to make a game similar to tower defense with our little twist of course.

### Java
I found that [Code academy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) teaches a Java course and it's also 4 hours. I decided that that's good enough to get familiar with the syntax of the language and all. So that was our first step to creating this game, learning the Java from Code Academy. 
I found out that it's not that different from Ruby, another coding language, the logic and everything seemed pretty familiar and I was in my comfort zone for some of the lessons in Code academy. 
The obvious difference was the syntax for example:
```
class Main {
  public static void main(String[] args) {
    System.out.println("hello world");
  }
}
```
In this snippet we see that to print out to the terminal we have to use ```System.out.println``` . I also noticed that I have to keep track of my ```;``` because the semi colon ends the code. 

### Checkout
Since this game isn't going to be easy to make, for week #2 I plan on finishing the code academy course and moving on to creating pseudo code for the big project. I'm expecting the graphics to be a challenge and some of the variables too; most likely there are probably a lot of things I have to keep track of. I'm also not so comfortable with loops and I can already tell there are gonna be a ton, so this project will hopefully get me comfortable with my weaknesses. There are a lot of things i'm gonna have to learn besides the syntax of Java and I will update on how that goes.
